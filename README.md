Movie Booking project is a movie booking desktop application and a term project in Programming Technique course. In this project, I use Java and NetBeans IDE for creating this application. I received the requirement from my professor that my ticket reservation system should allow bookings in a few easy steps. This is my first application that I created by Java. So, it will not has good UX/UI as it should be. However, this project let me practice OOP concept and how I can use Java to create UI.
